the decorator design pattern is similar but still different from python's decorator.
in the design pattern we can add extra functionalities to objects at runtime dynamically!!! 
which is pretty cool.



Component Interface:
    interface for the objects

Component:
    the object that may get decorated

Decorator:
    the class that applies extra responsibilities to the component being decorated.

    both component and decorataor will implement the component interface.
